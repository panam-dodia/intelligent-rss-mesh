# Demo Video Script (3 Minutes)

## 0:00 - 0:20 | Introduction (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Show landing page
**Narration**:
> "RSS Intelligence Mesh - resurrecting the dead art of RSS feeds with modern AI.
> Remember when RSS was the way to consume news? We're bringing it back, but smarter.
> This is my submission for the Kiro Hackathon - Resurrection category."

## 0:20 - 0:40 | The Problem (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Quick montage - news sites, social media feeds
**Narration**:
> "RSS died because it couldn't keep up with information overload.
> We solved this by adding AI cascade detection - when multiple sources mention
> the same entity, our system automatically detects patterns and generates intelligent synthesis."

## 0:40 - 1:10 | Feed Management Demo (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Navigate to Feeds page, show feed selection
**Actions**:
- Click "Feeds" in header
- Show grid of available feeds (Wired, Engadget, etc.)
- Click to activate 2-3 feeds
- Show "View Dashboard" button

**Narration**:
> "First, select your information sources. We aggregate from major tech publications.
> The system automatically fetches new articles every 30 minutes and processes them
> using NER and embeddings."

## 1:10 - 1:40 | Cascade Detection Demo (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Dashboard with cascades
**Actions**:
- Show stats: articles processed, cascades detected
- Highlight a cascade card (e.g., "Amazon")
- Point out velocity, source count, mention count
- Show recent articles in cascade

**Narration**:
> "Here's where it gets interesting. The system detected that 'Amazon' was mentioned
> across 4 different sources in the last hour - that's a cascade.
> We track velocity, cross-reference sources, and identify trending narratives automatically."

## 1:40 - 2:10 | AI Synthesis Demo (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Click "View AI Synthesis" button
**Actions**:
- Open synthesis modal
- Show GPT-4 generated summary
- Scroll through key points
- Show sources used

**Narration**:
> "Click to generate an AI synthesis. GPT-4 reads all related articles and creates
> an intelligent briefing - what's happening, why it matters, and what the different
> sources are saying. This is RSS on steroids."

## 2:10 - 2:40 | Technical Excellence (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Quick cuts showing code/architecture
**Screen text overlays**:
- "Parallel Processing - 4 workers"
- "Service Singletons - 100x speedup"
- "Vector Embeddings - Qdrant"
- "NER - spaCy"
- "Synthesis - GPT-4"

**Narration**:
> "Under the hood: parallel article processing with 4 workers, service singletons
> to avoid reloading ML models, vector embeddings for semantic search, named entity
> recognition, and GPT-4 synthesis. We optimized from 4.5 minutes per article
> down to 2-5 seconds - that's a 100x speedup."

## 2:40 - 3:00 | Kiro Usage & Close (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Show .kiro directory structure briefly, then back to app
**Screen text**:
- "Spec-Driven Development ✓"
- "Agent Hooks ✓"
- "Steering Docs ✓"
- "Vibe Coding ✓"

**Narration**:
> "Built entirely with Kiro using specs, hooks, and steering docs.
> What would take 3-4 days took 4 hours. Kiro diagnosed a critical performance bug
> and generated the fix in minutes. RSS Intelligence Mesh - the resurrection RSS deserves.
> Code and docs at [your-github-url]"

## Recording Tips:

1. **Use screen recording software** (OBS, Loom, QuickTime)
2. **Practice the timing** - keep it under 3 minutes
3. **Use cursor highlighting** so viewers can follow your clicks
4. **Clear your browser cache** for a clean demo
5. **Have some articles already processed** before recording
6. **Make sure cascades are visible** (run processing if needed)
7. **Test your microphone** - clear audio is crucial
8. **Show confidence** - this is impressive work!

## Pre-Recording Checklist:

- [ ] Backend running with data
- [ ] Frontend running smoothly
- [ ] At least 50+ articles processed
- [ ] Multiple cascades visible
- [ ] Test synthesis generation (make sure it works)
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs
- [ ] Set browser zoom to 100%
- [ ] Test audio recording quality

## Upload Instructions:

1. Export as MP4 (1080p recommended)
2. Upload to YouTube as **Unlisted** (or Public)
3. Title: "RSS Intelligence Mesh - Kiro Hackathon Submission"
4. Add description with GitHub link
5. Copy the YouTube URL for submission
